                <AccordionContent>
                  CAGR is the average annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period longer than one year. It provides a smoothed representation of the investment's performance, making it easier to compare with other investments.

                <AccordionContent>
                  Volatility measures how much an investment's price fluctuates. Higher volatility means higher risk but also the potential for higher returns. It's important to remember that the "expected return rate" is an average; actual returns will vary year to year.
